## Hi there 👋

The respositories here are supporting material for my ongoing tutorial on event-sourcing.

The tutorial (so far) is in the following articles:

1. [Event Sourcing — Background Information](https://medium.com/@aghuloum/event-sourcing-background-information-ca113c632936)
2. [Building a Simple Event Store](https://medium.com/@aghuloum/building-a-simple-event-store-98d7a804427)

The respositories in this project are:

* [eventsdb](https://github.com/event-sourcing-tutorial/eventsdb): An events database in PostgreSQL.
* [deployment](https://github.com/event-sourcing-tutorial/deployment): Deployment instructions and docker-compose file.

👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?

🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
